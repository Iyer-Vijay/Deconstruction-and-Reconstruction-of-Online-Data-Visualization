**Objective**

Objective: The objective of the visualization is to educate the general audience on world's top greenhouse gas (from different sectors) emitting countries for the year 2013.

Target Audience: General public all around the globe.

Issues with the chart:

- Pie chart is not a good representation for numbers, as pie chart uses angle for representation. Though the graph is interactive, it is very difficult to compare the values of each countries in a single view.
- Use of pie chart cramps up the value and becomes even more difficult to find out the Co2 Emission for certain sectors for some countries. To go in detail, looking at the pie chart, only Industrial sector is visible to naked eye for China, for rest it is very negligible and the Waste Sector cannot be found without clicking the smallest pie.
- As the blog is about world's top 10 greenhouse gas emitting countries, bombarding the visualization with too much information will confuse and deviate the user from the main underlying story. This pie chart makes the mistake of populating countries other than top 10. Instead of showing every country, a single value of rest of world would be good enough to compare the emission of top 10 vs rest of the world.

#### Code

The following code was used to fix the issues identified in the original.
